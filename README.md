# GradCAM
This repo contains 2 implementations of the GradCAM saliency map on the model provided in [this tutorial](https://captum.ai/tutorials/CIFAR_TorchVision_Interpret), on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
* The first implementation was adapted from [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@stepanulyanin/implementing-grad-cam-in-pytorch-ea0937c31e82).
* The second implementation directly used the [pytorch-grad-cam package](https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam).

Here are some sample results:
